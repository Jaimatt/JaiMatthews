        <h1>Countdown Generator</h1>
        <h2>Jai Matthews â‹… March 2023</h2>
        <p>Countdown is a simple website that allows users to generate a custom countdown to any date. It began when I wanted to create a countdown to the release of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - </em>which initially featured as an in-built countdown on the main page. But as I worked on the project, I decided to expand the scope slightly and implement the ability for users to make their own.</p>

        <h6>Countdown Editor</h6>
        <p>The primary reason I wanted to create my <em>own</em> countdown, rather than use an existing one online, was so I could create a simple, clean interface without external links or other associated clutter. Additionally, I wanted to count down by the <em>second! </em>My design features a straightforward white box, a full-screen image as the background, and some necessary information at the bottom.</p>

        <h6>Countdown to the release of Tears of the Kingdom</h6>
        <p>The programming behind the task was relatively straightforward, simply utilising timestamps of relevant dates to determine seconds remaining. Later, I added the ability to toggle between seconds and days, the latter of which describes the amount of times midnight passes rather than amount of 24-hour periods, which I feel is more intuitive for users to comprehend.</p>

        <h6>You can toggle between seconds and days</h6>
        <p>Instead of 'storing' countdowns, it goes to general page and passes the desired information through URL parameters, meaning copying a link can bring you - or others - back to your countdown any time you wish.</p>
