        <h1>About This Site</h1>
        <h2>jaimatthews.com</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Jai Matthews website! This site is a portal to various projects I have worked on over the course of the last few years. Please explore at your own leisure, most projects are available to view using the 'open' button. Many also have an <i class="fa fa-info" aria-hidden="true"></i> button that will take you to an article discussing the project where I show some of the code &amp; development stages.</p>
        <p>This article is replacing the old terms &amp; conditions page. I wrote that several years ago - at the time I thought it was very funny. You can still see this version of the page by clicking <a href="oldterms">here</a>.</p>
