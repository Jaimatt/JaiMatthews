        <h1>Balls</h1>
        <h2>JaiMatthews.com/Portfolio</h2>
        <p>'Balls' is an interactive animation named after the colourful balls that appear within it. It was created as a quick week-long project whilst I learnt how to use the HTML Canvas element and animate things on it using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>&lt;BALLS HOME SCREEN&gt;</p>
        <h6>Home Screen for "Balls" featuring 3 modes</h6>
        <p>To begin with, I learnt how the HTML Canvas actually works. I learnt that the canvas is a bitmap image with defined dimensions. I could draw things onto the canvas such as lines, rectangles, circles (called arcs), and images. For the purpose of this project, I chose to exclusively draw coloured circles. Code is required to begin the arc &amp; end it etc. and also to declare colour, position, whether it's filled in, and how much of the circle is shown.</p>
        <p>&lt;CODE&gt;</p>
        <h6>Code for drawing balls</h6>
        <p>To keep track of the balls, I would use classes (or, rather, constructor functions in this case) to define every ball's movement. Then I could create a new instance of this class whenever I wished and could add it to an array to keep track of it. A this.update() function would allow me to change the position of each ball by looping through every ball within the array.</p>
        <p>&lt;CODE&gt;</p>
        <h6>Constructor function for balls.</h6>
        <p>With this base code, I changed the specifics of this.update() for each animation. For instance, in the first animation - shatter - this.update() included code to move in a constant direction and bounce when it hits the walls.</p>
        <p>&lt;CODE&gt;</p>
        <h6>Code for SHATTER mode.</h6>
        <p>When the ball hits the wall it breaks into two smaller ones and continues the shatter every time it hits another wall. Another animation I created is 'Explosion', which uses gravity to create a firework-esque effect with sets of complementary colours. The third and final animation, 'Rainbow', features many small rainbow balls that grow with proximity to the mouse cursor.</p>
        <p>&lt;FIREWORK&gt;</p>
        <h6>Mode 2: Explosion</h6>
        <p>&lt;RAINBOW&gt;</p>
        <h6>Mode 3: Rainbow</h6>
        <p>Each animation also features a more intense mode toggleable using a button in the top left to make it extra-interesting.</p>
        <p>Balls is available to play with from your web browser on any device. Click <a href="../balls">here</a> is access it.</p>
