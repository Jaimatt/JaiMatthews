        <h1>Getting Trashed</h1>
        <h2>Jai Matthews â‹… 2021</h2>
        <p>Getting Trashed was a Year 10 computer science project whose aim was to teach people what bin to put their trash into. This was done creating a website where people could complete a quiz asking them which bin to put different types of trash into. </p>
        <p>Getting Trashed was a group project I worked on with <a href="https://twitter.com/Liberty_Tyrant" target="_blank">Tyrell Carli</a>. My task was to do the front-end design and create the quiz, whilst my collaborator worked on the back-end database and displaying data from it. Quite unfortunately his section was not completed, but a version of the website just including my sections exists.</p>

        <h6>Which bin does it go in?</h6>
        <p>When the game is finished, you're presented with your results including a brief message describing how well you went. I had <em>far</em> too much fun writing these messages.</p>

        <h6>Choosing a message.</h6>
        <p>
        This project was actually my first foray into using JavaScript. As such, it features a number of techniques that are perhaps best described as <em style="color: var(--text); font-size: 13px; text-align: left; background-color: var(--foreground);">questionable</em>. This includes the needless barrage of if-else statements above or, possibly worse, an astonishingly odd means of initialising an array as below.

        <h6>Oh dear...</h6>
        <p>Despite the fact that it was never properly finished, and that my code was very bad, I'm relatively happy with this particular project. It is available online <a href="https://jaimatthews.com/gettingtrashed/" target="_blank">here</a> if you'd like to have a go at the quiz.</p>
