        <h1>Game of the Year</h1>
        <h2>Jai Matthews ⋅ Ongoing</h2>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">You’ve found my game list! I don’t tend to advertise that this is a thing, but I’ve been doing this for a few years sort of as an exercise in reflection or perhaps just writing. In any case, I thought I’d post it here on my website.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">So how does it work? Well, every year, once a year, I choose one game I played through the year that I enjoyed the most. They’re not necessarily the most </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">advanced</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> game, not necessarily the most </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">popular</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">, they don’t even have to have been released during the year in question! Rather, the chosen game is merely the one that I loved the most, that had the greatest effect on me, or that had been the most important to me throughout my year.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Let’s get started!</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2017</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Super Mario Odyssey</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Super Mario Odyssey was actually the reason I bought a Switch in the first place.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Ever the Mario fan, I was thrilled to experience a sprawling world full of unique and imaginative landscapes through which I could “Wah”, “Hoo”, and “Wahoo” to my heart's content.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">The property of the game that had me the most excited was the expertly refined quality of Mario’s moveset. Super Mario Odyssey features a host of satisfying jumps &amp; tricks Mario can perform. His movement strikes a perfect balance of being easy to learn, but hard to master. And it filled me with an insatiable desire to get to the next ledge, reach the next power moon, and complete the next secret area. I always felt rewarded by my progress. Super Mario Odyssey is a standout game for the Switch and I will be playing it for years to come!</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2018</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Minecraft</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Minecraft needs no introduction. And, in fact, I was already extremely familiar with the game prior to the dawn of 2018.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Minecraft’s innate freedom gives way to ample reasons to come back to the game time &amp; time again. The freeing feeling this sandbox survival game gives is one that is captured by shockingly few games. I chose Minecraft as my pick for 2018 because this is the year where I felt I properly experienced the immense breadth of Minecraft’s diverse offerings. The year saw me play through some exciting survival worlds with friends, build (to my mind at least) elegant structures, enthusiastically learn the new 1.13 command structure and design all my favourite minigames. It was amazing to experience so many of the things that makes Minecraft as popular as it is.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2019</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Two years. It took me </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">two years</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> to finally get around to playing what was to become one of my favourite video games of all time. Breath of the Wild initially seemed outside of my comfort zone for video games. An adventure RPG? A moving &amp; voice-acted narrative? A daunting sense of complete freedom? Clearly outside of the safety of the marios &amp; pokemons a younger me would stubbornly cling to. But when I eventually convinced myself to take the risk, I found the richest, most moving, and most empowering game I’ve played. Breath of the Wild masterfully blends challenge, intrigue and charm into a game startlingly close to perfection. Breath of the Wild was the perfect game to break me out of the box I’d trapped myself in and thus stands as not just a game, but also a genuinely important experience for me.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2020</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Ori &amp; the Blind Forest</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Prompted by the release of Will of the Wisps, I decided to play the original Ori game; Ori &amp; the Blind Forest. What I was greeted with was a well-designed Metroidvania with an astonishingly beautiful presentation unlike anything I’d ever played. From the moment I booted up the game, I was overwhelmed by the beautiful vista of the Ginso tree set to its iconic choir-backed soundtrack. The emotional prologue further helped to set the tone of this game &amp; all throughout the game I was impressed by the immaculate beauty Moon Studios put into the world of Nibel. Additionally, the gameplay was </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">very </em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">fun! I particularly enjoyed using the innovative “Bash” ability &amp; the exciting, albeit stressful, escape sequences after each of the game's dungeons. Despite being in a genre I don’t usually enjoy, Ori captured my heart &amp; is a true work of art.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2021</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Metroid Dread</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Metroid Dread is great!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">I should probably write more about it but... I’m worried the E.M.M.I. might hear me! Shhh!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Seriously though play it. It’s terrifying, but awesome.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2022</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Inside</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">And we’re back to another Indie game! Metroid Dread threw us off last year, but we thankfully return to our rightful place. Truthfully, in a year that saw both Super Mario Bros. Wonder </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">AND</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Pikmin 4, it surprised even me that the modest puzzle platformer </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">Inside</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> made it to the top of my list.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Inside is awesome. To be honest, writing this is quite hard. And for two reasons. The first is that </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">Inside</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> is not a particularly innovative nor impressive game. I actually find it difficult to pinpoint just where its excellence stems from. Perhaps, it’s the perfectly curated atmosphere of the game? Or even some of the grotesque imagery, which left the game seared into my brain (in the best way possible!). Like it did to me, it’s a game that will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">The second reason is that I don’t want to spoil it! Almost anything I have to say might ruin one element of it. Whenever I recommend it to someone, I just tell them to stop listening to me and </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">go play it!</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> You certainly will not regret it!</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2023</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Celeste</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Before I start, I should probably acknowledge the Tears of the Kingdom in the room. I’ll confess I did not particularly enjoy Tears of the Kingdom. And, in any case, before I could get to it, another game came to me. One I was not prepared to love the way I did.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Celeste had been on my radar for a </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">very </em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">long time. Probably since its release. For some reason I thought that the game was a Metroidvania? Not being a huge fan of the genre, I filed the game under the “will get around to eventually” category. When, in April of this year, I discovered that it was, in fact, a </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">pure platformer</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">, I practically bought it on the spot! And I am so glad I did. In my mind Celeste is not a particularly innovative concept, but rather excels at the fact that every facet of its creation is carried out to an almost impossibly high standard. </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">The moveset?</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> The best I’ve ever played. </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">The level design?</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Every screen is fun, every death is fair. </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">The artwork?</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> It doesn’t cease to blow me away despite the limitations of its medium. </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">The Music?</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> I am always in absolute awe of Lena Raine’s talent. </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">And the story?</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> Well, this is what </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">truly </em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">fueled my interest in Celeste. A moving tale of overcoming anxiety &amp; depression, told through a fantasy setting &amp; a genius central metaphor. In addition to all this, it was really fascinating to think about Madeline’s transformative journey to be one of gender identity - a theme oft-neglect in the gaming industry! All in all, Celeste was a breathtaking experience that I would recommend to anyone interested in gaming, platforming, or just great stories.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">You will cry though. It’s hard. So, so fucking hard.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2024</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Celeste</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Okay, hear me out!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">I know this was my pick for last year. So, instead of reviewing the game as usual, allow me to persuade you as to why my blatant repetition is justified. First of all, I really didn’t play many games this year. I got back into Minecraft a bit, ultimately deciding I was better off without it. And I played The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, even if I was not a massive fan (though by no means was it a </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">bad</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> game!).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">But, for the most part, in the moments I did find myself gaming, it was Celeste. There was still plenty I hadn’t done. C-Sides, Golden Strawberries, even Farewell (because that bloody comb room could fuck off!!!). In many ways it’s become something of a comfort game. Something I could always go back to. Maybe I could try to beat my time on 2A? Get 6C golden? Try again for MoonBerry? If I may permit myself a moment of shameless bragging, I’ve become </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">quite</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> good at the game! As of writing, I have 100% as well as 12 golden strawberries (that’s right, bitch. get on my level).</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">To be honest, there’s not too much else to say given I’ve just chosen the same game again. I guess it was just </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">that</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> good. I’ll be back again in 2025, this time with a </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">different</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> game, I promise!</span>
        </p>
        <!-- <h4>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2025</span>
        </h4>
        <h3>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Passage</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">It’s not Celeste, don’t worry! Though I got into Strawberry Jam earlier this year, so quite frankly it was still a close call.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Truthfully, it’s been a weird time for me recently.&nbsp;</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">2025 is my second full year of feeling strangely uninterested in video games as a whole. It was never a conscious decision not to play games as much as I used to, but since late 2023 I’ve repeatedly gone months or more without touching my switch, and there have been very few games that I’ve properly played through in all that time. It’s even more bizarre because this year marked the release of the Switch 2 with the new Mario Kart World &amp; Donkey Kong Bananza, both of which look legendary yet I feel no overwhelming desire to play them. I’ll get around to them at some point, sure, but that pull isn’t as strong as it once was.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">This predicament makes this list feel a little weird to write. How can I have a favourite game if I didn’t play through any games?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Last year I sort of cheated and re-picked Celeste. This year I’m going to cheat again by picking Passage.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Whilst I didn’t </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">play</em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;"> games much this year, I did take one exciting step in the video game world: I </span>
        <em style="background-color: transparent;">made </em>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">a game! Now I won’t get ahead of myself; it was a team effort, and it was just a very simple prototype made in a week for the Flinders Games Research Lab Mid-Year Game Jam. But in spite of that I had more fun working on that game than playing any video game in quite a long time! I won’t lie, our game is not one to be taken seriously. It’s a quirky little minigame with plenty of janky physics. But making it taught me a lot. About Unity and programming, but also about collaboration and just how valuable teamwork is to these sorts of creative pursuits. It was truly eye-opening and was a wonderful experience. For this reason, I thought Passage deserves the spot this year.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">If you’d like to play Passage, there’s a link to it on my website. That’ll take you to an itch.io page with more information about the game and a link to download it for free. Thanks to everyone who made it with me! It was lots of fun.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
        <span style="background-color: transparent;">Hopefully in 2026 I won’t need to cheat again!</span>
