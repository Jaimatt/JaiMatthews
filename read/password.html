        <h1>The Password Company</h1>
        <h2>Jai Matthews â‹… March 2022</h2>
        <p>The Password company is a small project made for a Year 11 computer science class. In it, users can make an account, sign in, sign out, and do other things commonly associated with an account system. Yes, it's a website that is <em>solely</em> an account system. I had some interesting school projects.</p>

        <h6>The Account Creation Screen</h6>
        <p>Being predominantly a learning opportunity, the website has a number of... uh.. <em>quirks</em>. First of all, it runs entirely in vanilla JavaScript. Of course, this means you can just open the inspect element, but it doesn't strictly matter as the point of the project was never achieving genuine security.</p>
        <p>Another "quirk" is the extremely strict requirements for making a password. This was because a part of the project was to practice this kind of error/ exception handling.</p>

        <h6>Stringent Password Requirements</h6>
        <p>Being relatively new to JavaScript (and programming as a whole) at the time of writing the code for this project, I was not super familiar with the different variable formats and had to figure out the best way of saving users' usernames and passwords to the system. The format I decided upon at the time was not particularly optimal, but it worked. Each type of data was in a separate list as below.</p>
