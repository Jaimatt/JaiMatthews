        <h2>Tyrell Carli</h2>
        <p><i>Leader, Founder, CEO & Chairperson</i></p>
        <p>“Be like No Kum-Sok, betray the communists.”</p>
        <p>Tyrell is the next genius of the 21st century. He is the God Emperor of the Team known only as Carli & Co. Being the Founder of the team, he was the obvious choice for leader. His exceptional leadership skills and his constant need to be in control make him a perfect choice to rule our team. Carli & Co. has met much success due to his intelligence and grandeur. He’s bravely walked our team into many a challenge and, when he had to, has accepted bad press with divine humility. We love our supreme leader. All hail Tyrell, his imperial majesty, emperor of Carli & Co., ruler of all. I’m not at all being forced to write this.

        <h2>Jai Matthews</h2>
        <p><i>Lead Graphic Designer</i></p>
        <p>“We all like to let Tyrell pretend he’s in charge. In actuality he’s not – I am.”</p>
        <p>Jai is well known around the world as a lethal assassin. He is wanted 322 countries, so he is banned from all of them. Whilst his targets rarely put up a fight, this is largely because they are all geese. Nonetheless, the international ban persists. Jai cannot live in any of the world’s 322 countries, with the only exception being Paris. There are no geese in Paris. Jai, however, chooses not to live there because Paris is a shithole. Therefore, Jai works for Carli & Co. via zoom calls from the middle of the ocean where he cannot be prosecuted for his assassinations. Carli & Co. has been kind to allow Jai to work for them. Luckily, none of them are geese.</p>

        <h2>Mark Gurney</h2>
        <p><i>Glasses Representative</i></p>
        <p>“…And that’s why I shop at woollies!” </p>
        <p>Mark Gurney is one of the newest additions to our team. He does an excellent job in his coding endeavours. Hand chosen to be in our team by the imperial majesty himself, Mark is a whizz in the fields of HTML, CSS, ABC, Python, Snake, Anaconda, Cobra, JavaScript, C++, C+++++, C+++++++ and more. Unfortunately, his legitimacy has been in question ever since we found out most of these languages don’t actually exist. Nevertheless, these skills make him an invaluable team member. He is a huge help to our team outside of the coding world but is also solely responsible for the creation of the entire website you are now looking at.

        <h2>Jett De Salvo</h2>
        <p><i>Executive of Human Resources</i></p>
        <p>“Go away. Stop touching me.”</p>
        <p>Jett De Salvo. The man, the myth, the legend. The accusations of a*s grabbing in his early days ultimately led him to be in charge of Carli & Co.'s H.R. department. It seems strange, almost paradoxical, but I assure you it makes sense. When his team noticed the repetition of his dastardly crime, they criticised him to no end. Soon after that he swore to redemption. Though no one believed him at first, his a*s grabbing seemed to stop overnight. This path of improved behaviour led him to become the official head of human resources. A position from which he could ensure that no one would grab another team member’s a*s ever again.
