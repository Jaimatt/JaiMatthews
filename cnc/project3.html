    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 22%; margin-right: 22%; font-style: italic;">To advertise an overtly evil bank, we thought to entice customers by drawing into the true evil that is inside all of us at all times.</p>

        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>This week, we created a radio ad for Carli and Bank. The ad depicted a man recounted the atrocities of his bank and then encouraging the audience to "embrace your inner evil". Of course, some people aren't actually evil (or at least they think they're not) so this ad wouldn't work on everyone. However, this ad would work on those who are more suggestible, or those who genuinely think they're evil. In particular, those who believe evil to be a "cool" or even potentially "masculine" trait. To help fuel this, we used a deeper, male, voice to further tap into the "cool" stereotype.
        </p>
        <p>One thing that you'll notice in listening to our ad is the different voices that appear at different parts of the ad. Given that part of our audience includes the low attention spanning young people, this helps to ad some auditory variety to the ad. Additionally, the use of the same voice at the start and ends gives the impression that there is a sensible circular narrative to how it's presented. This also gives the audience something to think about as to not zone out.
        </p>
        <p>With our message of being evil, we want to be able to bring people's buried evil tendencies to the surface or even make them angry. The creepy music that is played throughout helps to instill the tone of evilness. We even chose a different component of the song with an extra instrument for the ending to aid in the variety. We hope that the evil music helps to make people think they're evil. The sound effects you can hear throughout help to add an eerie sense to the ad. Perhaps even the annoyingness of it helps to make people angry. Anger being a potentially evil quality, this is beneficial to us.
        </p>
        <p>Finally there's the ads' dialogue. It was carefully scripted and went through a couple of changes after the first draft was completed. The goal essentially was to slowly increase the severity of the crimes. We started with a fairly obvious one, climate change. We then moved into genuine atrocities that banks in the real world do "encourage gamblers, cripple small businesses and charge customers after they have died". Then we move into some more joke-like evils such as arson to add a comedic tone before bringing it back with some more serious and vague ideas "pull the strings of the Australian Government and associate with malicious organisations". This variety hopefully gave customers a range of evils to clearly see the bank was overall evil. But the comedic evils hopefully helped to make the bank more relatable. Interestingly, we chose mostly to focus on evils behind the scenes rather than those that directly affect the customer as to not make the customer fear being hurt.
        </p>
        <p>The two main changes that were made to the dialogue in the final draft was that we added "We are all evil on the inside" to the beginning, so that we didn't just start listing evils and confusing the audience. We also changed one of our lines from "…associate with pro-life organisations…" to "…associate with malicious organisations…" following a debate within the team regarding the ethics of including a line like that within an ad.

        <h2>Transcript</h2>
        <p>We are all evil on the inside.</p>
        <p>In the past, we have funded multi-billion dollar fossil fuel companies, inadvertently aiding in the rapid destruction of the climate.</p>
        <p>We actively encourage gamblers, cripple small businesses and charge customers after they have died.</p>
        <p>We have been linked to the shutting down of 7 orphanages since 1983 and 4 arson cases in the last decade. We pull the strings of the Australian Government and associate with malicious organisations, all whilst abusing and under-paying our own workers.</p>
        <p>Embrace your inner evil.</p>
        <p>Make the switch.</p>
        <p>Carli And Bank.</p>
