        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>This week we were encouraging people to go to music festivals without dancing. The method through which we chose to do this was to isolate a specific demographic and target them. The demographic we chose was the 50+ age bracket - old people. There were quite a few methods through which we decided to target old people. </p>
        <p>The first of which was to use a bold and simple typography that would be easy to read for those with deteriorating eyesight. Therefore it would not alienate or confuse the older target demographic we had chosen. We also did some research to find that there is a specific set of colours that appeal to old people more than others. We used these colours to try attract and appeal to our demographic.</p>
        <p>The line we show on the image reads "No Dancing, No Distraction, No Danger". The first of these essentially contradicts the audience's assumed pre-established notions. The second and third reinforce their pre-established ideas in order to help change their mind on the first one.</p>
        <p>The main decision we had to make was through which medium we would advertise. Obviously facebook would we the most common one used by old people, so that would be the one we put the most resources into. We would, however, also use Twitter and Instagram to target those who may be using the apps to 'feel' young. Additionally, this helps to target some potential customers that may not be in our target demographic.</p>
        <p>Finally, here's the text we have included in the post:</p>
        <p><i>No dancing, no distraction, no danger. Just come along and get ready for the nostalgia trip of your life!</i> | This line opens the audience up to intrigue.</p>
        <p><i>Carli & Concert by Carli & Co. is coming to Adelaide in February 2022.</i> | This line establishes a location and makes the event more real.</p>
        <p><i>Featuring The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen and more, Carli & Concert is not to be missed!</i> | This line tries to add clarification to the event and appeal to the target.</p>
        <p><i>See you there!</i> | The final line entices the audience.</p>
