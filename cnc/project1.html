    <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 22%; margin-right: 22%; font-style: italic;">To properly create this ad, Carli & Co. thought 'Who are the real beneficiaries of the vaccine, and do we actually care about them?'</p>
    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        <p>First of all, to add clarity to what's going on, the ad is meant to feature old people but at the last minute we had to replace our actors with Mark Gurney. He made a great replacement, but we did lose some of the meaning attributed to the ad.</p>
        <p>The primary target demographic for this advertisement is young people and those below the age of 50. We attempted to target those who may not have cared about those older than them or people who may not have many connections to the High Risk ages of 65+. For this reason we used light hearted music and humour ("They're going to die anyway") to entice a younger, more immature, audience. The rapid change in tone (when the voiceover starts) also aids to the humour of the piece. This essentially catches the audience with "fun" without having the ad's inherent morbidity scare them off.</p>
        <p>Given that our demographic is largely young people, we have taken further steps to aid the method through which they tend to absorb media. Because they are unlikely to be giving the ad their complete attention, much of the dialogue can be skipped without losing meaning to the ad and simple fonts are used that don't require too much concentration. Additionally, we have provided captions to make the ad more accessible in mediums without audio (e.g. scrolling through social media).</p>
        <p>This ad was actually our plan B in terms of advertising. Our original plan was to focus more on the vaccine hesitancy and less on spreading the virus by showing the vaccine system as a means of conformity. However, the idea was replaced due to its large ambition.</p>
