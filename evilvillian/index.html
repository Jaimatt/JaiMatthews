            Augustus Hasntgotaname, now known as Dr. Hasntgotaname after he graduated last year with a PhD in advanced chair analysis, has spent his life in an unending hatred of Kettles (not the chip brand). Unfortunately for Augustus, the NAKA (National Anti-Kettle Association - an organization he founded himself back in 1981) has met little success with only 8 members ever joining. Despite 40 years of vigorous kettle raids, comprehensive Anti-Kettle propaganda & countless cupcake-related fundraisers, Hasntgotaname has been unable to eradicate Kettles from the world. And with his kettle kill tally at only 26, he is running out of hope.
            <br><br>
            Dr. Hasntgotaname has hated kettles for his entire life ever since a particularly malicious kettle murdered his parents. His oddly short mother was trying to reach a kettle on a high shelf by tugging on the cord. Little did she know that the kettle was turned on and full of water. The kettle landed on her head and killed her in a instant. When Augustus' father found the body, he tried to help, but was electrocuted within seconds. Augustus, only 8 years old, got home 2 hours later to see his parents' lifeless corpses lying on the floor and atop their bodies, a kettle. He sat with them for 2 days before help arrived.
            <br><br>
            Recently, Augustus has been able to get into contact with Josh Epidemiology - an expert in the field of Epidemiology. Interestingly, a direct descendant of Martin Epidemiology - the creator of Epidemiology. Josh & Augustus have been undergoing intense collaboration over the past 4 months to develop a plan to finally eradicate Kettles from the world!
            <br><br>
            With sufficient funding, Josh plans to engineer a special virus with the unique power that it could kill every frog no the planet. With this virus finalised and functional, Augustus will threaten the United Nations with it. The virus that could kill all frogs. He will tell them 'Destroy all the kettles! Or I destroy all the frogs!'. After the Human population becomes aware of the horrific life that would arise from a world without frogs, they will collectively agree to destroy all of their kettles forever.
            <br><br>
            With kettles gone, Augustus will finally be able to rest well, knowing that his life work has been worth it and that he has finally been able to avenge his parents. He will have finally eradicated kettles from the world. He will have achieved his life-long dream without having to hurt a soul.
